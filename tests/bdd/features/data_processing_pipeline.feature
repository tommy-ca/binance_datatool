Feature: Advanced Data Processing Pipeline with Quality Controls
  As a Quantitative Analyst
  I want standardized data processing with quality controls
  So that I can improve data quality by 85% and reduce time-to-insight by 60%

  Background:
    Given Data Processing Pipeline system is deployed
    And multi-format data ingestion is configured
    And quality validation rules are defined

  @ingestion @validation
  Scenario: Multi-Format Data Ingestion with Real-time Validation
    Given cryptocurrency market data in various formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet, Avro, Protocol Buffers)
    When data ingestion process runs
    Then all major cryptocurrency data formats should be processed without manual intervention
    And data quality issues should be detected within 30 seconds of ingestion
    And schema changes should be handled gracefully with backward compatibility
    And complete data lineage should be available for all processed datasets

  @transformation @enrichment
  Scenario: Advanced Data Transformation and Enrichment
    Given raw cryptocurrency market data requiring transformation
    When transformation engine processes the data
    Then complex transformations should be defined and version controlled as code
    And technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) should be calculated automatically
    And linear performance scaling should work up to multi-TB processing
    And incremental processing should reduce processing time by 80%

  @quality @scoring
  Scenario: Comprehensive Data Quality Assessment
    Given ingested data requiring quality validation
    When quality validation framework runs
    Then multi-dimensional quality scoring (0-100 scale) should be available
    And schema validation with drift detection should work
    And statistical outlier detection should flag anomalies
    And business rule validation should enforce price ranges and volume limits

  @catalog @discovery
  Scenario: Intelligent Data Cataloging and Discovery
    Given processed datasets requiring cataloging
    When cataloging system runs
    Then all processed datasets should be automatically cataloged with comprehensive metadata
    And users should find relevant datasets using business terms and use cases
    And dataset usage patterns should be tracked for optimization decisions
    And seamless data access should work from Jupyter and analytical tools

  @performance @throughput
  Scenario: High-Throughput Processing Performance
    Given large-scale data processing requirements
    When processing engine handles 10TB+ daily volume
    Then processing should complete with sub-linear resource scaling
    And streaming processing should achieve <1 second latency
    And CPU and memory utilization should exceed 85% during processing
    And columnar processing with Apache Arrow should optimize performance

  @reliability @consistency
  Scenario: Data Processing Reliability and Consistency
    Given critical data processing workflows
    When processing operations execute
    Then processing success rate should exceed 99.9%
    And zero data loss or corruption should occur during processing
    And processing should be resumable from last successful checkpoint
    And fault-tolerant processing should provide automatic recovery

  @features @engineering
  Scenario: Automated Feature Engineering for Analytics
    Given raw market data requiring feature engineering
    When feature engineering pipeline runs
    Then SQL-based transformations with window functions should work
    And Python UDF support should enable complex calculations
    And time-series resampling and aggregation should be available
    And cross-asset correlation and market regime detection should be automated

  @integration @platforms
  Scenario: Analytical Platform Integration
    Given various analytical platforms requiring data access
    When integration components are utilized
    Then data connectors should provide direct access for exploratory analysis
    And performance optimization should work for Jupyter notebooks
    And OLAP optimization should support business intelligence tools
    And feature store integration should support ML platforms

  @security @governance
  Scenario: Data Security and Governance
    Given sensitive financial data requiring protection
    When security controls are applied
    Then role-based access control should work with fine-grained permissions
    And PII detection and masking should be automated
    And complete audit trail should log all data access and modifications
    And GDPR compliance capabilities should be functional

  @scalability @volume
  Scenario: Scalable Processing Architecture
    Given growing data volumes and processing requirements
    When system scales to handle increased load
    Then horizontal scaling should provide linear performance scaling
    And multi-tenant resource isolation should work with quotas per team
    And petabyte-scale storage should maintain query performance optimization
    And processing should handle continuous operations with 1000+ files

  @metadata @lineage
  Scenario: Comprehensive Metadata and Lineage Tracking
    Given complex data transformations and processing stages
    When metadata management system operates
    Then automatic schema and statistics collection should work
    And business glossary and tag management should be available
    And data quality scores and freshness indicators should be tracked
    And sample data preview and profiling should be accessible
