Feature: Unified Observability Integration with OpenTelemetry
  As a Site Reliability Engineer
  I want comprehensive system observability
  So that I can reduce mean time to resolution by 60%

  Background:
    Given OpenObserve unified observability platform is deployed
    And OpenTelemetry instrumentation is configured
    And all system components are monitored

  @telemetry @instrumentation
  Scenario: Comprehensive Telemetry Collection
    Given all services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry
    When system operates under normal conditions
    Then all services should emit traces, metrics, and logs in OTLP format
    And zero-code instrumentation should work for Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
    And custom business metrics should be collected for archive collection and transfers
    And consistent metadata and labeling should enable correlation across signals

  @monitoring @alerts
  Scenario: Intelligent Monitoring and Alerting
    Given dynamic threshold detection is configured
    When system behavior patterns change
    Then alert thresholds should automatically adjust based on historical patterns
    And related alerts should be grouped into single incidents
    And critical alerts should reach on-call engineer within 2 minutes
    And alerts should include system context and remediation guidance

  @dashboards @visualization
  Scenario: Role-based Dashboards and Visualization
    Given dashboards are configured for different user personas
    When users access their role-specific dashboards
    Then SRE, Platform Engineers, and Data Engineers should have tailored dashboards
    And dashboards should update within 30 seconds
    And time-series analysis and drill-down capabilities should be available
    And mobile-responsive design should work for on-call access

  @performance @metrics
  Scenario: Performance Metrics and Analytics
    Given comprehensive performance instrumentation
    When S3 Direct Sync and Archive Collection operations execute
    Then custom business metrics should be collected and displayed
    And operation count, transfer speeds, and efficiency metrics should be tracked
    And database query performance and connection pool metrics should be available
    And external API call latency and error rates should be monitored

  @traces @correlation
  Scenario: Distributed Tracing and Correlation
    Given W3C Trace Context is implemented across all services
    When complex workflows execute with multiple service interactions
    Then distributed traces should span all service boundaries
    And trace-to-log-to-metric correlation should achieve >90% accuracy
    And span attributes and events should provide detailed context
    And trace correlation IDs should be present in structured logs

  @reliability @availability
  Scenario: Observability Infrastructure Reliability
    Given observability platform requirements for high availability
    When system operates under various load conditions
    Then observability infrastructure should maintain 99.9% uptime
    And telemetry loss should be <0.1% during system failures
    And alert delivery should achieve 99.99% success rate
    And automatic failover should work seamlessly

  @security @privacy
  Scenario: Security and Privacy Protection
    Given telemetry data contains potentially sensitive information
    When telemetry is collected and transmitted
    Then end-to-end encryption should be enforced
    And role-based access control should protect observability data
    And automatic PII detection and redaction should work in logs and traces
    And complete audit trail should track all configuration changes

  @integration @platforms
  Scenario: Platform Integration and Compatibility
    Given integration with OpenObserve, Kubernetes, and AWS services
    When telemetry flows through the observability pipeline
    Then OTLP ingestion should work with multi-tenancy support
    And Kubernetes pod metadata should be enriched automatically
    And AWS CloudWatch integration should provide cost optimization
    And service dependency mapping should be accurate

  @performance @overhead
  Scenario: Low-Overhead Telemetry Collection
    Given instrumentation overhead requirements
    When system operates under normal and peak loads
    Then instrumentation overhead should be <100ms for all operations
    And dashboard updates should occur within 30 seconds
    And telemetry ingestion should support 100K+ metrics/second
    And 10K+ traces/second should be processed efficiently

  @anomaly @proactive
  Scenario: Proactive Issue Detection and Prevention
    Given machine learning-based anomaly detection
    When system behavior deviates from normal patterns
    Then >80% of issues should be detected before user impact
    And trend analysis should provide predictive alerting
    And service dependency mapping should enable impact analysis
    And alert suppression should work during maintenance windows
