Feature: Enhanced Archive Collection with Intelligent Discovery
  As a Data Engineer
  I want automated archive discovery and collection workflows
  So that I can reduce manual coordination time by 70%

  Background:
    Given Enhanced Archive Collection system is deployed
    And multiple cryptocurrency exchange APIs are accessible
    And destination storage is configured

  @discovery @automation
  Scenario: Intelligent Archive Discovery
    Given configured data sources including Binance, Coinbase, and FTX archives
    When automated discovery process runs every 4 hours
    Then new archive data should be discovered within 30 minutes of availability
    And discovery success rate should be >98%
    And comprehensive metadata should be extracted for >99% of discovered archives
    And discovery should support 5+ major cryptocurrency exchanges

  @workflow @automation
  Scenario: Automated Collection Workflow Execution
    Given high-priority trading data is discovered
    When automated collection workflow is triggered
    Then high-priority data should be collected within 2 hours
    And workflow should execute with >99% reliability
    And system should maintain <80% resource utilization during peak periods
    And collection should achieve >60% performance improvement using S3 Direct Sync

  @monitoring @realtime
  Scenario: Real-time Collection Monitoring
    Given collection operations are running across multiple sources
    When I access the monitoring dashboard
    Then dashboard should update within 30 seconds of status changes
    And alerts should be triggered within 5 minutes of failure detection
    And metrics should be available for >95% of collection operations
    And historical data should be retained for 12 months

  @efficiency @performance
  Scenario: Collection Workflow Efficiency
    Given multiple concurrent collection sources (20+)
    When collection workflows execute simultaneously
    Then collection automation rate should be >90%
    And time to data availability should be <2 hours for critical data
    And collection reliability should achieve >99% success rate
    And single source failure should not impact other collections

  @integration @s3sync
  Scenario: S3 Direct Sync Integration
    Given archive collection workflow with large datasets
    When collection uses S3 Direct Sync feature
    Then collection performance should improve by >60%
    And fallback mechanisms should work seamlessly
    And performance monitoring should provide real-time status

  @discovery @realtime
  Scenario: Multi-Source Discovery Coordination
    Given discovery jobs for Binance, Coinbase, and custom S3 buckets
    When discovery cycle runs across all sources
    Then full source discovery should complete <15 minutes per source
    And discovery should handle 20+ concurrent sources
    And discovery should maintain <5% performance degradation

  @quality @validation
  Scenario: Data Quality and Integrity Validation
    Given collected archive data from multiple sources
    When quality validation is performed
    Then data completeness should be >95% across all sources
    And zero data corruption should occur with checksum validation
    And data quality scores should be tracked and reported
    And quality issues should be detected within 30 seconds

  @scalability @volume
  Scenario: Large-Scale Archive Collection
    Given petabyte-scale archive collections
    When system processes 10TB daily collection volume
    Then performance should scale linearly with data volume
    And horizontal scaling should work without downtime
    And storage growth should be accommodated seamlessly

  @alerting @monitoring
  Scenario: Intelligent Alerting and Error Handling
    Given collection operations with potential failure scenarios
    When failures or performance degradation occur
    Then configurable alert thresholds should trigger notifications
    And multi-channel notifications should work (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
    And smart alert correlation should reduce noise
    And alert acknowledgment and resolution should be tracked
