Feature: Advanced Workflow Orchestration with Intelligent Execution
  As a Data Engineer
  I want intelligent workflow orchestration
  So that I can reduce pipeline failures by 75% and improve development efficiency by 60%

  Background:
    Given Prefect-based workflow orchestration is deployed
    And Kubernetes execution environment is available
    And workflow definitions are managed as code

  @definition @management
  Scenario: Declarative Workflow Definition and Management
    Given complex data processing requirements
    When I define workflows using Python-based DSL
    Then workflows should support DAG, sequential, parallel, and conditional patterns
    And workflow definitions should be version controlled with Git integration
    And dynamic workflow generation should adapt to data characteristics
    And workflow versioning and rollback capabilities should be available

  @execution @intelligence
  Scenario: Intelligent Workflow Execution Engine
    Given various workflow execution scenarios
    When workflows are scheduled and executed
    Then smart scheduling should optimize based on data availability and resource capacity
    And dynamic resource allocation should scale based on workflow requirements
    And 80%+ of transient failures should be automatically recovered
    And maximum parallelism should be achieved while respecting dependencies

  @monitoring @observability
  Scenario: Comprehensive Workflow Monitoring
    Given executing workflows with various complexities
    When I monitor workflow execution
    Then all workflow stages should be monitored with <30 second update latency
    And performance metrics should be available with trend analysis
    And alerts should be triggered within 2 minutes of issue detection
    And workflow metrics, logs, and traces should integrate with OpenObserve

  @performance @throughput
  Scenario: High-Performance Workflow Execution
    Given high-throughput workflow requirements
    When 1000+ concurrent workflows are executed
    Then system should support concurrent executions with minimal degradation
    And workflow scheduling should take <5 seconds from trigger to execution start
    And resource utilization should exceed 80% during peak loads
    And linear scaling should work with additional compute resources

  @reliability @recovery
  Scenario: Fault Tolerance and Error Recovery
    Given workflows with potential failure points
    When failures occur during execution
    Then workflow execution reliability should exceed 99%
    And mean time to recovery should be <15 minutes
    And ACID properties should be maintained across workflow boundaries
    And partial workflow restart from checkpoint should work

  @integration @s3sync
  Scenario: S3 Direct Sync Task Integration
    Given workflows requiring high-performance data transfers
    When S3 Direct Sync is used as workflow tasks
    Then task integration should provide progress monitoring
    And error propagation should work correctly
    And performance improvements should be measurable within workflows

  @patterns @complexity
  Scenario: Complex Workflow Pattern Support
    Given various data processing workflow patterns
    When I implement ETL, stream processing, and ML training pipelines
    Then workflow should support multi-stage pipelines with dependency management
    And parallel collection from multiple sources should work
    And intelligent retry and error recovery mechanisms should function
    And progress tracking and status reporting should be comprehensive

  @scalability @resources
  Scenario: Resource Management and Scaling
    Given varying resource requirements across workflows
    When workflows execute with different resource needs
    Then multi-tenant resource isolation should work with quotas
    And workflows should support up to 1000+ tasks
    And resource pooling and sharing should optimize utilization
    And load balancing should distribute work across available resources

  @api @management
  Scenario: API-Driven Workflow Management
    Given workflow management requirements
    When I interact with workflows programmatically
    Then all operations should be available via REST API
    And workflow catalog should provide search and discovery
    And workflow validation and testing framework should be available
    And documentation generation should be automated

  @development @efficiency
  Scenario: Development Workflow Efficiency
    Given workflow development and deployment requirements
    When developers create and deploy workflows
    Then pipeline development velocity should improve by >60%
    And workflow-as-code practices should be supported
    And blue-green deployment capability should be available
    And automated rollback should work on deployment failures
