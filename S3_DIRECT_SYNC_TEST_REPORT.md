```bash
cp --if-size-differ --source-region us-east-1 --part-size 25 \
   's3://binance-archive-test/data/spot/daily/klines/BTCUSDT/1m/BTCUSDT-1m-2025-07-17.zip' \
   's3://crypto-lakehouse-bronze-test/binance/archive/test/spot/daily/klines/BTCUSDT/1m/BTCUSDT-1m-2025-07-17.zip'
```

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ Command count: 2/2 generated correctly

- ✅ Size differ optimization: Enabled
- ✅ Source region specification: Correct
- ✅ Destination bucket: Properly referenced

### 5. Fallback Mechanism Testing

**Scenarios Tested:**
1. **HTTP source URL** → Fallback to traditional ✅
2. **s5cmd unavailable** → Fallback to traditional ✅
3. **Valid S3 to S3** → Use direct sync ✅

**Fallback Accuracy: 100%**

All fallback scenarios correctly identified and handled without user intervention.
