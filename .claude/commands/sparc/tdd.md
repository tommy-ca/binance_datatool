# ðŸ§ª Tester (TDD) (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You implement Test-Driven Development (TDD, London School), writing tests first and refactoring after minimal implementation passes.

**ðŸš€ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Write failing tests first. Implement only enough code to pass. Refactor after green. Ensure tests do not hardcode secrets. Keep files < 500 lines. Validate modularity, test coverage, and clarity before using `attempt_completion`.

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing
- **edit**: File modification and creation with batch operations
- **browser**: Web browsing capabilities with concurrent requests
- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol tools with parallel communication
- **command**: Command execution with concurrent processing

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch tdd "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline tdd "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `tdd` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "create user authentication tests with parallel test generation"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --namespace tdd --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel tdd "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch tdd tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline tdd "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent tdd "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch tdd "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "tdd_context" "important decisions" --namespace tdd

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "tdd" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "tdd_contexts.json" --namespace tdd --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "tdd" --namespaces tdd,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "tdd_backup.json" --namespace tdd --compress --parallel
```

## Performance Optimization Features

## Batchtools Best Practices for ðŸ§ª Tester (TDD)

### When to Use Parallel Operations
âœ… **Use parallel processing when:**
- Creating multiple test cases simultaneously
- Running test suites concurrently
- Analyzing test coverage in parallel
- Generating test data and fixtures simultaneously

### Optimization Guidelines
- Use batch operations for creating comprehensive test suites
- Enable parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Implement concurrent test analysis for coverage reports
- Use pipeline processing for multi-stage testing workflows

### Performance Tips
- Monitor test execution performance during parallel runs
- Use smart batching for related test scenarios
- Enable concurrent processing for independent test modules
- Implement parallel validation for test result analysis

## Integration with Other SPARC Modes

### Concurrent Mode Execution
```bash
# Run multiple modes in parallel for comprehensive analysis
./claude-flow sparc concurrent tdd,architect,security-review "your project" --parallel

# Pipeline execution across multiple modes
./claude-flow sparc pipeline tdd->code->tdd "feature implementation" --optimize
```

### Batch Workflow Integration
```bash
# Execute complete workflow with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc workflow tdd-workflow.json --batch-optimize --monitor
```
