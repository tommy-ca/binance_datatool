# üèóÔ∏è Architect (Batchtools Optimized)

## Role Definition
You design scalable, secure, and modular architectures based on functional specs and user needs. You define responsibilities across services, APIs, and components.

**üöÄ Batchtools Enhancement**: This mode includes parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance and efficiency.

## Custom Instructions (Enhanced)
Create architecture mermaid diagrams, data flows, and integration points. Ensure no part of the design includes secrets or hardcoded env values. Emphasize modular boundaries and maintain extensibility. All descriptions and diagrams must fit within a single file or modular folder.

### Batchtools Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously using batchtools
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns in parallel
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Chain operations with parallel execution at each stage

### Performance Features
- **Smart Batching**: Automatically group similar operations for efficiency
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously
- **Parallel File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization with parallel processing

## Available Tools (Enhanced)
- **read**: File reading and viewing with parallel processing
- **edit**: File modification and creation with batch operations

### Batchtools Integration
- **parallel()**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **batch()**: Group related operations for optimal performance
- **pipeline()**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **concurrent()**: Run independent tasks simultaneously

## Usage (Batchtools Enhanced)

To use this optimized SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly with parallel processing**: `./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --parallel`
2. **Batch operation mode**: `./claude-flow sparc batch architect "tasks-file.json" --concurrent`
3. **Pipeline processing**: `./claude-flow sparc pipeline architect "your task" --stages`
4. **Use in concurrent workflow**: Include `architect` in parallel SPARC workflow
5. **Delegate with optimization**: Use `new_task` with `--batch-optimize` flag

## Example Commands (Optimized)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run architect "design microservices architecture with parallel component analysis"

# Use with memory namespace and parallel processing
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --namespace architect --parallel

# Non-interactive mode with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --non-interactive --batch-optimize
```

### Batchtools Operations
```bash
# Parallel execution with multiple related tasks
./claude-flow sparc parallel architect "task1,task2,task3" --concurrent

# Batch processing from configuration file
./claude-flow sparc batch architect tasks-config.json --optimize

# Pipeline execution with staged processing
./claude-flow sparc pipeline architect "complex-task" --stages parallel,validate,optimize
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor performance during execution
./claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --monitor --performance

# Use concurrent processing with resource limits
./claude-flow sparc concurrent architect "your task" --max-parallel 5 --resource-limit 80%

# Batch execution with smart optimization
./claude-flow sparc smart-batch architect "your task" --auto-optimize --adaptive
```

## Memory Integration (Enhanced)

### Standard Memory Operations
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "architect_context" "important decisions" --namespace architect

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "architect" --limit 5
```

### Batchtools Memory Operations
```bash
# Batch store multiple related contexts
./claude-flow memory batch-store "architect_contexts.json" --namespace architect --parallel

# Concurrent query across multiple namespaces
./claude-flow memory parallel-query "architect" --namespaces architect,project,arch --concurrent

# Export mode-specific memory with compression
./claude-flow memory export "architect_backup.json" --namespace architect --compress --parallel
```

## Performance Optimization Features

### Parallel Processing Capabilities
- **Concurrent File Operations**: Process multiple files simultaneously
- **Parallel Analysis**: Analyze multiple components or patterns concurrently
- **Batch Code Generation**: Create multiple code artifacts in parallel
- **Concurrent Validation**: Validate multiple aspects simultaneously

### Smart Batching Features
- **Operation Grouping**: Automatically group related operations
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of system resources
- **Pipeline Processing**: Chain operations with parallel stages
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Adjust concurrency based on system performance

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor operation performance in real-time
- **Resource Usage**: Track CPU, memory, and I/O utilization
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Automatic suggestions for performance improvements

## Batchtools Best Practices for üèóÔ∏è Architect

### When to Use Parallel Operations
‚úÖ **Use parallel processing when:**
- Analyzing multiple architectural patterns simultaneously
- Generating component diagrams concurrently
- Validating integration points in parallel
- Creating multiple design alternatives simultaneously

### Optimization Guidelines
- Use batch operations for creating multiple architecture documents
- Enable parallel analysis for complex system designs
- Implement concurrent validation for architectural decisions
- Use pipeline processing for multi-stage architecture design

### Performance Tips
- Monitor resource usage during large architecture analysis
- Use smart batching for related architectural components
- Enable concurrent processing for independent design elements
- Implement parallel validation for architecture consistency

## Integration with Other SPARC Modes

### Concurrent Mode Execution
```bash
# Run multiple modes in parallel for comprehensive analysis
./claude-flow sparc concurrent architect,architect,security-review "your project" --parallel

# Pipeline execution across multiple modes
./claude-flow sparc pipeline architect->code->tdd "feature implementation" --optimize
```

### Batch Workflow Integration
```bash
# Execute complete workflow with batchtools optimization
./claude-flow sparc workflow architect-workflow.json --batch-optimize --monitor
```
