**Error Scenario**:
- **Condition**: Database connection timeout or failure
- **Response**: Enable read-only mode, show maintenance page
- **Graceful Degradation**: Allow viewing of cached data
- **Recovery**: Automatic reconnection attempts every 30 seconds

**Rationale**: {{RATIONALE_1}}  
**Verification**: Database failover testing  
**Priority**: Must Have

#### REQ-UNWANTED-002: Authentication Service Unavailability
**If** the external authentication service is unavailable, **then** the system shall use cached user credentials and provide limited functionality.

**Error Scenario**:
- **Condition**: External auth service timeout or 5xx errors
- **Response**: Fall back to cached authentication state
- **Limitations**: Read-only access, no new authentications
- **Monitoring**: Alert operations team immediately

**Rationale**: {{RATIONALE_2}}  
**Verification**: Service availability testing  
**Priority**: Should Have

## Quality Attributes

## Behavior-Driven Development Scenarios

### Feature: User Authentication

#### Background
```gherkin
Given the authentication system is running
And the user database is available
And the JWT signing key is configured
```

#### Scenario 1: Successful Login
```gherkin
Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
  Given a user with email "user@example.com" exists
  And the user has password "SecurePassword123!"
  And the user account is active
  When the user submits the login form with correct credentials
  Then the system should authenticate the user
  And the system should return a valid JWT token
  And the token should contain user ID and role
  And the token should expire in 15 minutes
  And the user should be redirected to the dashboard
  And a successful login event should be logged
```

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Credentials
```gherkin
Scenario: User attempts login with wrong password
  Given a user with email "user@example.com" exists
  When the user submits the login form with email "user@example.com" and password "WrongPassword"
  Then the system should reject the authentication
  And the system should display "Invalid email or password"
  And the system should not return any authentication token
  And a failed login attempt should be logged
  And the user should remain on the login page
```

#### Scenario 3: Account Lockout
```gherkin
Scenario: Account gets locked after multiple failed attempts
  Given a user with email "user@example.com" exists
  And the user has failed login 2 times in the last 10 minutes
  When the user submits incorrect credentials again
  Then the system should lock the user account
  And the system should display "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed attempts"
  And the system should prevent any login attempts for 15 minutes
  And an account lockout event should be logged
  And an email notification should be sent to the user
```

#### Scenario 4: Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)
```gherkin
Scenario: User completes 2FA authentication flow
  Given a user with email "user@example.com" exists
  And two-factor authentication is enabled for this user
  When the user submits correct email and password
  Then the system should send an SMS verification code to the user's phone
  And the system should display the 2FA verification form
  And the system should not complete authentication yet
  When the user enters the correct 6-digit verification code within 5 minutes
  Then the system should complete the authentication
  And the system should return a valid JWT token
  And a successful 2FA login should be logged
```
