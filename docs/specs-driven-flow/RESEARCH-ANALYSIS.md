## üîç Research Findings

### 1. Amazon Kiro IDE - Revolutionary Specs-Driven Approach (2024-2025)

#### Overview
Amazon Web Services launched Kiro IDE in July 2025, representing a paradigm shift from "vibe coding to viable code" through an AI-powered, specification-driven development environment.

#### Core Methodology: Three-File Specification System

**1. Requirements.md**
- Uses EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Developed by Rolls-Royce for constrained textual requirements
- Five main requirement patterns:
  - Ubiquitous Requirements (universally true)
  - Event-Driven Requirements (`When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>`)
  - State-Driven Requirements (`While <condition>, the <system> shall <response>`)
  - Optional Feature Requirements (`Where <feature>, the <system> shall <response>`)
  - Unwanted Behavior Requirements (`If <condition> Then <response>`)

**2. Design.md**
- Describes tech stack and architecture
- Creates data flow diagrams
- Defines TypeScript interfaces
- Specifies database schemas
- Details API endpoints

**3. Tasks.md**
- Series of discrete implementation steps
- From development through deployment
- Task dependencies and sequencing
- Resource allocation and timelines

#### Development Workflow
```
1. Prompt ‚Üí Spec Generation (Requirements, Design, Tasks)
2. Collaborative Spec Refinement
3. AI Agent Implementation
4. Human Oversight and Control
5. Production Deployment
```

#### Key Features
- **Agent Hooks**: Event-driven automations that execute on file save/create
- **Spec-First Approach**: Code generation only after complete specification
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: Maintains human control while leveraging AI capabilities
- **Production-Ready Focus**: Eliminates traditional prototyping-to-production gap

#### Pricing Model (2025)
- Preview: Free with full feature access
- Post-Preview:
  - KIRO FREE: $0/month (50 agent interactions)
  - KIRO PRO: $19/month (1,000 interactions)
  - KIRO PRO+: $39/month (3,000 interactions)

### 2. EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) - Industry Standard

#### Background
- Developed by Alistair Mavin and Rolls-Royce PLC team (2009)
- Presented at Requirements Engineering (RE 09) conference
- Widely adopted across aerospace, automotive, and software industries

#### Modern Tool Support (2024)
- **Visure Solutions**: Full EARS support with predefined templates
- **Jama Software**: Continued EARS notation support
- **Modern SRS Tools**: Integration with structured phrasing frameworks

#### Benefits for Specification-Driven Development
- **Enhanced Clarity**: Structured requirements reduce ambiguity
- **Improved Traceability**: Easy lifecycle tracking
- **Better Collaboration**: Bridges technical/non-technical communication gaps
- **Standardization**: Consistent requirement format across teams

#### EARS Pattern Examples
```
Ubiquitous: The system shall encrypt all data at rest.

Event-Driven: When a user submits invalid credentials, 
the system shall display an error message.

State-Driven: While the system is in maintenance mode, 
the system shall reject all user requests.

Optional Feature: Where two-factor authentication is enabled, 
the system shall require SMS verification.

Unwanted Behavior: If the database connection fails, 
then the system shall switch to read-only mode.
```

### 3. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) - Collaborative Specifications

#### Core Philosophy
- Closes gap between business people and technical people
- Encourages collaboration across roles
- Works in rapid, small iterations
- Produces automatically verified system documentation

#### Gherkin Language Structure
```gherkin
Given [initial context]
When [triggering event]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional conditions]
But [exceptions]
```

#### Modern BDD Tools (2024)
- **Cucumber**: Multi-language support (Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Python, .NET)
- **SpecFlow**: .NET-focused BDD framework
- **Behave**: Python-specific BDD framework
- **JBehave**: Java-based BDD with JUnit/TestNG integration

#### BDD Benefits for Specs-Driven Development
- **Clear Requirements**: Plain language scenarios reduce ambiguity
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as up-to-date specification
- **Early Defect Detection**: Behavior focus identifies issues early
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: User behavior focus ensures comprehensive testing

### 4. Requirements Driven Development (RDD) - Modern Approaches

#### Traditional RDD (Visure/ALM Platforms)
- Design, development, and testing driven by business/technical requirements
- Full traceability from requirements through delivery
- Compliance and project delivery focus
- Integration with ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) platforms

#### Pragmatic RDD (2024 Evolution)
- Efficiency and speed focused
- AI tool integration for rapid iteration
- Focus on building features vs. exhaustive testing upfront
- Validation-focused: "Did we build the right thing?"

#### Modern RDD Components
- **Requirements Gathering**: Stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints
- **Requirements Analysis**: Clarification, prioritization, feasibility assessment
- **Validation Focus**: Continuous verification of business value delivery
- **Agile Integration**: Iterative RDD process for changing requirements
