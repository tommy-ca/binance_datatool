# Phase 1: Specifications
# Specs-Driven Development Flow | Requirements Definition
# ================================================================

## Purpose

Define comprehensive, measurable, and testable specifications that serve as the foundation for all subsequent development phases. Every requirement must be traceable, verifiable, and directly linked to business value.

## 📋 Specification Types

### 5. Acceptance Criteria
**Definition**: Testable conditions that must be met for feature acceptance
**Format**: YAML with Given-When-Then scenarios
**Validation**: Criteria completeness and testability validation

```yaml
# acceptance-criteria.yml
acceptance_criteria:
  feature_id: "FEAT001"
  
  scenarios:
    - id: "AC001"
      title: "Successful User Login"
      given: "User has valid credentials"
      when: "User submits login form"
      then: 
        - "User is authenticated successfully"
        - "JWT token is generated and returned"
        - "User is redirected to dashboard"
        - "Login event is logged"
      test_type: "automated"
