# Spec-Driven Development Workflow
# Version: 3.0.0 | SPARC Integration | Modern UV Workflow
# ================================================================

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive spec-driven development workflow for the crypto data lakehouse platform, integrating SPARC methodology with modern UV package management and automated quality gates.

## Workflow Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Specification-First Development**: Every feature begins with a complete specification
2. **SPARC Methodology Integration**: Systematic application of Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, and Completion phases
3. **Automated Quality Gates**: Continuous validation at every workflow stage
4. **UV-Native Operations**: All dependency management uses modern UV commands
5. **Measurable Outcomes**: Every workflow stage produces measurable artifacts
6. **Continuous Feedback**: Real-time feedback loops for immediate course correction
