# Crypto Lakehouse Platform Specifications
# Centralized Specification Reference | Version 3.0.0 (CONSOLIDATED)
# ================================================================

## üìã Overview

This directory serves as the centralized reference for all technical specifications in the Crypto Data Lakehouse platform. Following hive mind swarm reorganization, **all feature-specific specifications have been consolidated into their respective feature directories** under `docs/features/` to establish single source of truth architecture.

## üéØ Consolidated Architecture (NEW)

**Breaking Change**: As of Version 3.0.0, all component specifications have been **moved to their respective feature directories** to eliminate duplication and establish clear ownership:

### ‚úÖ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETED
- **Infrastructure Specifications** ‚Üí Moved to **[S3 Direct Sync Feature](../features/s3-direct-sync/01-specs/)**
- **Performance Specifications** ‚Üí Moved to **[S3 Direct Sync Feature](../features/s3-direct-sync/01-specs/)**
- **Security Specifications** ‚Üí Moved to **[S3 Direct Sync Feature](../features/s3-direct-sync/01-specs/)**
- **Architecture Specifications** ‚Üí Moved to **[S3 Direct Sync Feature](../features/s3-direct-sync/02-design/architect/)**
- **Validation Specifications** ‚Üí Moved to **[S3 Direct Sync Feature](../features/s3-direct-sync/05-validation/)**

## üóÇÔ∏è Current Structure

### Core Project Documentation
- **[Project Specification](../project-specification.md)** - Main technical specification for the entire platform (moved to root docs/)

### Feature-Based Specifications
All detailed specifications are now organized by feature in the **[Features Directory](../features/)**:

#### üîÑ [S3 Direct Sync](../features/s3-direct-sync/)
**Complete Infrastructure & Performance Specifications**
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure specifications (Prefect + s5cmd + MinIO)
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks and SLA requirements  
- ‚úÖ Security requirements and compliance
- ‚úÖ Technical architecture and deployment
- ‚úÖ Validation criteria and acceptance tests

#### üìä [Enhanced Archive Collection](../features/enhanced-archive-collection/)
**Event-Driven Architecture Specifications**

#### üîç [Observability Integration](../features/observability-integration/)
**OpenTelemetry Implementation Specifications**

#### ‚öôÔ∏è [Workflow Orchestration](../features/workflow-orchestration/)
**CQRS + Event Sourcing Specifications**

#### üè≠ [Data Processing Pipeline](../features/data-processing-pipeline/)
**Lambda Architecture Specifications**

## üéØ Specs-Driven Development Methodology

This project follows a **specs-driven development approach** where:

1. **Specifications First** - Technical requirements are documented before implementation
2. **Implementation Compliance** - Code must comply with documented specifications
3. **Validation Against Specs** - Testing validates implementation against specifications
4. **Continuous Updates** - Specifications are updated as requirements evolve

For detailed methodology, see: **[Specs-Driven Flow Documentation](../specs-driven-flow/README.md)**
