## üîó Service Integration

### Service Dependencies
- **[Infrastructure Platform](../infrastructure-platform/)** - Platform storage and operations APIs
- **[Archive Collection Orchestrator](../archive-collection-orchestrator/)** - Receives collection tasks
- **External Data Sources** - Exchange APIs and archive repositories

### Service Interfaces
- **Analytics Services** - Collection metrics and performance data
- **Monitoring Systems** - Worker health and performance monitoring
- **Storage Platform** - Result data storage and archival

### Task Processing
```yaml
Task Consumption:
  - collection_task: Execute data collection from specified source
  - validation_task: Validate previously collected data
  - retry_task: Retry failed collection with updated parameters
  - cleanup_task: Clean up temporary processing resources

Status Reporting:
  - task_started: Collection task execution started
  - task_progress: Periodic progress updates during collection
  - task_completed: Collection task successfully completed
  - task_failed: Collection task failed with error details
```

### REST APIs
```yaml
Worker Management:
  - GET /workers: List active worker instances
  - GET /workers/{id}/status: Get specific worker status
  - PUT /workers/{id}/pause: Pause worker task consumption
  - PUT /workers/{id}/resume: Resume worker operations

Task Management:
  - GET /tasks/active: List currently executing tasks
  - GET /tasks/{id}: Get specific task status and progress
  - PUT /tasks/{id}/cancel: Cancel running task
  - GET /tasks/{id}/logs: Get task execution logs
```

## üè≠ Worker Pool Architecture

### Scaling Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add worker instances based on queue depth
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase worker resources for larger archives
- **Specialized Workers**: Different worker types for different data sources
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on workload and performance

### Worker Types
1. **Standard Workers**: General-purpose collection workers
2. **High-Throughput Workers**: Optimized for large archive collections
3. **Specialized Workers**: Exchange-specific collection logic
4. **Validation Workers**: Data integrity and format validation

### Resource Management
- **CPU Intensive**: Optimized for data processing and compression
- **Network Intensive**: High-bandwidth workers for large downloads
- **Memory Optimized**: Workers for large archive processing
- **Storage Optimized**: Workers with fast local storage for processing
