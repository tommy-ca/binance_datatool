# Archive Collection Orchestrator
# Workflow Coordination Microservice | Version 1.0.0 (MICROSERVICE)
# ================================================================

## üìã Overview

The Archive Collection Orchestrator is a specialized microservice responsible for coordinating and managing archive collection workflows across distributed data collection workers. Extracted from Enhanced Archive Collection to provide centralized workflow orchestration with event-driven coordination.

**Service Status**: ‚úÖ **MICROSERVICE EXTRACTED**  
**Architecture**: Microservice (Orchestration Domain)  
**Version**: 1.0.0 (Initial microservice extraction)

## üéØ Service Responsibilities

## üîó Service Integration

### Service Dependencies
- **[Infrastructure Platform](../infrastructure-platform/)** - Platform orchestration and messaging APIs
- **[Archive Discovery Service](../archive-discovery-service/)** - Consumes discovery events
- **Configuration Service** - Workflow templates and orchestration rules

### Service Consumers
- **[Data Collection Workers](../data-collection-workers/)** - Receives collection tasks
- **Monitoring Dashboard** - Queries workflow status and metrics
- **Analytics Services** - Workflow completion events and metadata

### Event Processing
```yaml
Events Consumed:
  - archive_discovered: Triggers collection workflow creation
  - collection_completed: Updates workflow status
  - collection_failed: Handles failure recovery
  - worker_status_changed: Adjusts resource allocation

Events Published:
  - workflow_created: New collection workflow initiated
  - workflow_completed: Collection workflow finished
  - task_assigned: Collection task assigned to worker
  - workflow_failed: Collection workflow failed
```

### Command/Query APIs
```yaml
Command APIs:
  - POST /workflows: Create new collection workflow
  - PUT /workflows/{id}/pause: Pause running workflow
  - PUT /workflows/{id}/resume: Resume paused workflow
  - DELETE /workflows/{id}: Cancel workflow

Query APIs:
  - GET /workflows: List workflows with status
  - GET /workflows/{id}: Get workflow details
  - GET /workflows/{id}/tasks: Get workflow task status
  - GET /metrics: Get orchestration performance metrics
```

## üé≠ Workflow Patterns

### Collection Workflow Types
1. **Scheduled Collection**: Periodic collection of new archives
2. **Event-Driven Collection**: Triggered by discovery events
3. **On-Demand Collection**: Manual collection requests
4. **Recovery Collection**: Failed collection retry workflows

### Coordination Patterns
- **Saga Pattern**: Long-running workflow coordination with compensation
- **Circuit Breaker**: Worker failure isolation and recovery
- **Bulkhead**: Resource isolation between workflow types
- **Retry with Backoff**: Intelligent failure recovery

## üöÄ Service Benefits
