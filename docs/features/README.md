## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Specs-Driven Development Process

Each feature follows the standardized 5-phase development methodology:

```
Phase 1: SPECS → Phase 2: DESIGN → Phase 3: TASKS → Phase 4: IMPLEMENTATION → Phase 5: VALIDATION
     ↓                    ↓                  ↓                      ↓                        ↓
Requirements        Architecture      Development         Code & Tests            Quality Gates
Documentation       Component Design  Task Breakdown      Implementation          Acceptance Testing
Acceptance Criteria API Specifications Resource Planning   Documentation          Performance Validation
```

### Quality Gates

**Phase Completion Requirements:**
- **Specs Phase**: Requirements traceability, stakeholder approval, acceptance criteria
- **Design Phase**: Architecture consistency, component validation, design review approval
- **Tasks Phase**: Complete task breakdown, dependency mapping, resource allocation
- **Implementation Phase**: >95% test coverage, >8.5/10 code quality, performance targets met
- **Validation Phase**: All tests passing, acceptance criteria validated, deployment readiness

### Feature Development Commands

```bash
# Navigate to feature directory
