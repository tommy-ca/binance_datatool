  - GET /platform/tasks/{id}: Get task execution status
  - PUT /platform/tasks/{id}/cancel: Cancel running task
  - GET /platform/capacity: Get available platform capacity

Resource APIs:
  - GET /platform/resources: Query available resources
  - POST /platform/resources/reserve: Reserve resources for execution
  - DELETE /platform/resources/{id}: Release reserved resources
  - GET /platform/resources/usage: Get resource utilization metrics

State APIs:
  - PUT /platform/state/{key}: Store execution state
  - GET /platform/state/{key}: Retrieve execution state
