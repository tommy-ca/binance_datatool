## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Startup Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check service logs
   docker-compose logs [service-name]
   kubectl logs deployment/[service-name] -n crypto-lakehouse
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Test PostgreSQL connectivity
   psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U prefect -d prefect
   ```

3. **MinIO Access Issues**
   ```bash
   # Test MinIO connectivity
   mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 admin password123
   mc ls local/
   ```

4. **Observability Data Missing**
   ```bash
   # Check OpenTelemetry collector
   curl http://localhost:13133/
   # Check Prometheus targets
   curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
   ```

### Log Locations

- **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose logs -f [service]`
- **K3s**: `kubectl logs -f deployment/[service] -n [namespace]`
- **Local Files**: `./logs/[service]/`

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation

**Development Environment**:
- Total RAM: 8GB recommended
- CPU Cores: 4+ recommended
- Storage: 50GB+ available

**Production Environment**:
- Total RAM: 16GB+ per node
- CPU Cores: 8+ per node
- Storage: 500GB+ per node

### Scaling Guidelines

**Horizontal Scaling**:
```bash
# Scale Prefect workers
kubectl scale deployment prefect-worker --replicas=5 -n crypto-lakehouse

# Scale s5cmd service
kubectl scale deployment s5cmd-service --replicas=3 -n crypto-lakehouse
```

**Vertical Scaling**:
- Increase resource limits in manifests
