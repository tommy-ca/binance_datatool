# Feature: test-auth

**Feature ID**: FEAT807  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Team**: development-team  
**Author**: tommyk  
**Created**: 2025-07-19

## Overview

This feature follows the specs-driven development flow with 5 phases:

1. **[Specs](./01-specs/)** - Requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **[Design](./02-design/)** - System and component design
3. **[Tasks](./03-tasks/)** - Task breakdown and planning
4. **[Implementation](./04-implementation/)** - Test-driven development
5. **[Validation](./05-validation/)** - Comprehensive testing and validation

## Quick Start

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to feature directory
cd features/test-auth

# Phase 1: Complete specifications
make specs-phase

# Phase 2: Create design
make design-phase

# Phase 3: Plan tasks
make tasks-phase

# Phase 4: Implement feature
make implementation-phase

# Phase 5: Validate and test
make validation-phase
```

## Quality Gates

Each phase has quality gates that must pass before proceeding:

### Phase 1: Specs Quality Gates
- [ ] All specifications complete and validated
- [ ] Requirements traceability established
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and measurable
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

### Phase 2: Design Quality Gates
- [ ] Architecture consistent with requirements
- [ ] Component designs complete and validated
- [ ] API specifications defined
- [ ] Design review completed and approved

### Phase 3: Tasks Quality Gates
- [ ] All tasks identified and estimated
- [ ] Dependencies mapped and validated
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed
- [ ] Timeline approved

### Phase 4: Implementation Quality Gates
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥ 95%
- [ ] Code quality score â‰¥ 8.5/10
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security validation passed

### Phase 5: Validation Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Acceptance criteria validated

## Development Commands

```bash
# Initialize phase
make init-phase PHASE=01-specs

# Validate phase completion
make validate-phase PHASE=01-specs

# Generate phase report
make phase-report PHASE=01-specs

# Run quality gates
make quality-gates PHASE=01-specs
```
