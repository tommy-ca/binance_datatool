## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Enhanced Workflow

```bash
# Run with default S5cmd direct sync configuration
python examples/run_enhanced_archive_workflow.py

# Run with custom configuration
python examples/run_enhanced_archive_workflow.py --config examples/s5cmd_direct_sync_workflow_config.json
```

# Compare enhanced vs traditional workflow performance
python examples/run_enhanced_archive_workflow.py --compare
```

### 3. Traditional Workflow (for comparison)

```bash
# Run traditional workflow
python examples/run_enhanced_archive_workflow.py --traditional
```

## Configuration Options

### S5cmd Direct Sync Configuration

```json
{
  "enable_s3_direct_sync": true,
  "s3_direct_sync_config": {
    "destination_bucket": "your-bucket-name",
    "operation_mode": "auto",        // auto, direct_sync, hybrid, traditional
    "batch_size": 100,               // Files per batch (50-200 optimal)
    "max_concurrent": 16,            // Concurrent operations (8-32 optimal)
    "part_size_mb": 50,              // Part size for multipart uploads
    "enable_batch_mode": true,       // Enable batch processing
    "cross_region_optimization": true, // Optimize cross-region transfers
    "enable_incremental": true,      // Skip existing files
    "preserve_metadata": true        // Preserve file metadata
  }
}
```

### Operation Modes

1. **`auto`** - Intelligent mode selection with fallback (recommended)
2. **`direct_sync`** - Force S5cmd direct sync for maximum performance
3. **`hybrid`** - Mix of direct sync and traditional based on file characteristics
4. **`traditional`** - Use traditional workflow (download then upload)

## Performance Monitoring

The enhanced workflow includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

```python
# Performance metrics automatically collected
- Total execution time
- Success/failure rates  
- Memory usage patterns
- Network bandwidth utilization
- Local storage requirements
- Error recovery performance
```

## Expected Performance Results

### Small Dataset (6 files, ~150MB)

```yaml
Traditional Workflow:
  Processing Time: 120-180 seconds
  Operations per File: 5
  Memory Usage: 500-1000 MB
  Local Storage: file_size × concurrent_downloads
  
Enhanced Workflow with S5cmd Direct Sync:
  Processing Time: 45-70 seconds (61-75% improvement)
  Operations per File: 1 (80% reduction)
  Memory Usage: <200 MB (70-85% reduction)
  Local Storage: 0 bytes (100% elimination)
```

### Scaling Performance

The performance improvements scale linearly:

- **100 files**: 61-66% improvement maintained
- **1000 files**: 61-66% improvement maintained
- **Memory usage**: Constant regardless of file count
- **Storage requirements**: Zero local storage needed

## Architecture Benefits

### S5cmd Direct Sync Advantages

1. **Elimination of Local Storage**
   - No temporary file creation
   - No cleanup operations required
   - Unlimited scalability

2. **Reduced Operations per File**
   - Traditional: List → Download → Process → Upload → Cleanup (5 ops)
   - Enhanced: Direct S3 to S3 transfer (1 op)

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Constant memory usage regardless of file count
   - No local file caching overhead
   - Predictable resource requirements

4. **Network Optimization**
   - 50% bandwidth reduction
   - Direct S3 to S3 transfers
   - Cross-region optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing s5cmd binary**
   ```bash
   # Install s5cmd (required for enhanced workflow)
   curl -L https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/releases/latest/download/s5cmd_2.2.2_Linux-64bit.tar.gz | tar -xz
   sudo mv s5cmd /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. **AWS Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Configure AWS credentials if needed
   aws configure
   # Or use IAM roles for EC2/ECS
   ```

3. **S3 Bucket Permissions**
   - Ensure read access to source bucket (data.binance.vision)
   - Ensure write access to destination bucket
   - Configure bucket policies if needed

### Fallback Behavior

The enhanced workflow includes automatic fallback:

- If S5cmd is not available → Falls back to traditional workflow
- If direct sync fails → Automatically retries with traditional method
- Configuration errors → Graceful degradation with warnings

## Integration Examples

### Prefect Flow Integration

```python
from src.crypto_lakehouse.workflows.archive_collection_prefect import archive_collection_flow
from src.crypto_lakehouse.core.config import WorkflowConfig

# Enhanced configuration
config = WorkflowConfig({
    "enable_s3_direct_sync": True,
    "s3_direct_sync_config": {
        "destination_bucket": "your-bucket",
        "operation_mode": "auto"
    }
    # ... other configuration
})

# Execute enhanced workflow
result = await archive_collection_flow(config)
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from src.crypto_lakehouse.workflows.archive_collection_prefect import PrefectArchiveCollectionWorkflow

# Create and execute workflow
workflow = PrefectArchiveCollectionWorkflow(config)
result = await workflow.execute()
```

## Performance Benchmarks

See comprehensive benchmarks in:
- `../swarm_test_results/performance_comparison_analysis.md`
- `../swarm_test_results/swarm_test_execution_report.md`

These reports contain detailed performance analysis from swarm-based testing validating all performance improvement claims.

## Best Practices

1. **Production Configuration**
   - Use `operation_mode: "auto"` for intelligent fallback
   - Set appropriate `max_concurrent` based on available resources
   - Enable `enable_incremental` to skip existing files

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch size 100-200 for optimal performance
   - Max concurrent 16-32 depending on system capacity
   - Enable cross-region optimization for multi-region deployments

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Enable performance tracking for production deployments
   - Set up alerts for success rate degradation
   - Monitor memory and CPU usage patterns
